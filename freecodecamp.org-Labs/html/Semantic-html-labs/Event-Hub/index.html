                <h3>Sushi Night</h3>
                <p>Our most popular event, Sushi Night! This night was a special one. Tuna expert brought a whole tuna to cut live. They taught us the different cuts of the tuna and how it's taste varies by the location and fat content. Later on we were able to taste the different parts and see for ourselves the flavor each cut had. My favorite was the "chutoro" (medium fatty tuna) nigiri.</p>

                <h3>Sunday Brunch</h3>
                <p>For our past Sunday Brunch, we enjoyed delicious Fluffy Pancakes. These pancakes originated in Japan, and they were one of kind. When you shaked the plate the pancakes would jiggle. They were so light and fluffy. The flavor was just the right amount of sweet. I could have eaten a whole other serving.</p>
